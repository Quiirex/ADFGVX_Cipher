# ADFGVX Cipher

A python + tkinter implementation of the ADFGVX cipher for the Slovenian alphabet from scratch.

## The background

The ADFGVX cipher is a World War I era German field cipher. It uses a grid filled with a secret mixed alphabet and a columnar transposition based on a keyword. The name comes from the six letters used in the cipher: A, D, F, G, V, X. Itâ€™s an extension of the earlier ADFGX cipher, with an additional letter, V, added in June 1918 to expand the grid to 6x6, allowing for more characters.
